# K-means-clustering 
Cluster location using airbnb dataset in Ireland into groups based on the position preferences by implementing the k-means algorithm in python 
# Location Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering in python 

## Introduction 
K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm and it works as follows:
1. Choose the number of clusters into which the data are to be divided into
2. Assign arbitrarily the cluster centres 
3. Assign data points to cluster centre that is nearest to them, most commonly using the Euclidean distance formula
4. Once all the data points have been clustered to their respective clusters, calculate the centroid for each cluster using the
mean values of the data points assigned to that cluster
5. Reset cluster centres using those new centroids
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until no re-assignment of cluster centres occur i.e. until the algorithm has fully converged

## Problem statement 
Cluster location based on position in Ireland based on customer preference.

## Data description 
Airbnb dataset
